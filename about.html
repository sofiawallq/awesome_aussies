        <h2>A short history lesson on the Aussie</h2>
        <p>You’d be forgiven for thinking Australian shepherds originated in Australia. But these ranch dogs are
          actually American—by way of Spain. Aussies originated in California in the 19th century, bred initially for
          ranch work in the harsh and varied climes of the western state. And while there is some debate about the
          veracity of this claim, many experts believe that Australian shepherds originated from the dogs that Basque
          people —coming from a mountainous region between Spain and France—brought with them to the U.S. to work as
          shepherds.

          So where does the Australian label come from? According to some, many of these Basque shepherds came to
          California by way of Australia. Still others claim the name comes from the fact that many sheep at the time
          the breed first emerged were brought over from Australia. As for the mini Aussie, this scaled-down version was
          first bred in California in the 1960s as a livestock herder.</p>

        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>With strong working instincts, particularly the instinct to herd and drive groups of animals, and a
          natural suspicion of strangers, the Australian Shepherd is devoted to their owners, and loves to be a
          part of family life, if that family can offer the right active lifestyle. Early dog socialisation with
          other animals and children is vital, and Aussies must be given a job to do, and plenty of physical and
          mental exercise to keep them satisfied and content. For the right owner, they can be the perfect dog but
          like most working breeds, a bored Aussie is a nightmare to live with.</p>

        <h2>Appearance and Markings</h2>
        <p>The recognized colors are blue merle, red (liver) merle, solid black, and solid red (liver) all with or
          without white markings and/or tan (copper) points with no order of preference. The blue merle and black
          have black pigmentation on nose, lips, and eye-rims. Reds and red merles have liver pigmentation on
          nose, lips, and eye rims. Butterfly nose should not be faulted under one year of age. On all colors, the
          areas surrounding the ears and eyes are dominated by color other than white. The hairline of a white
          collar does not exceed the point at the withers. These are all distinct genetic traits and breeders need
          to understand how they are inherited.</p>

        <h2>Training</h2>
        <p>Aussies need plenty of physical exercise: no less than one hour per day, and preferably upwards of two hours.
          This goes for both standard and mini Aussies.

          Beyond the physical however, Aussies need to work out their brains. Even if you were to run them for hours,
          they still might display destructive or maladaptive behavior (digging, chewing, barking, etc.). In fact, all
          dogs need mental stimulation: it tires them out as much or more than physical stimulation, and as we know, a
          tired dog is a happy dog.

          Whether playing fetch or hide and seek, signing them up for agility training, building an obstacle course in
          your backyard, or consistently practicing obedience skills, you’ll see the animated spirit of the Aussie
          really come to life when they get to use their sharp minds and herding instincts.</p>
