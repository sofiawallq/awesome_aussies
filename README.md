The content of the about-page comes from the 

###The Contact Page
Since the site can only hold some general information, the Contact Page is a chance for the user to ask other more specific questions they have about the breed that they didn’t find an answer to. The will be asked to provide their full name and e-mail adress so that the people behind the webpage will know whom and where to send the reply. 
It also features a larger area for the question or questions – which is made up of additional rows to provide the user with the possibility to write some more content than what a single lie provides them with. 
The Contact-form is responsive to all devices and the text changes size according to device to provide a better user experience. All input-text is required for the user to put in so 

This page gets its content from the contact.html file, and its looks and features from style.css. 


##Features left to Implement

Possible additional pages 
For this website to be of actual use to a user that is about to purschase a new dog, a page filled with links to different types of kennels would be a good idea som that the user can navigate further once the current webpage has filled it’s purpose. 
Another useful feature would have been to 


##Testing

##Validator testing

..* HTML
..* CSS
..* Accessibility using Lighthous

##Unfixed bugs

From what I know there are no unfixed bugs, but the flex-box features were the biggest challenge for the project. Also finding the right margins and size of the content for different devices to make the user experience comfortable proved to be the biggest challenge in this particular project – mainly because the feature consists of only texts and images. Some more interactive features with videos and maybe a quiz-section would have added some more value to the user, but the main focus of the page is to show that the basic structure and features of HTML and CSS have been implemented.

###Content
..*The text for the different sections on the About the breed page were taken form Wikipedia (länk) and The farmers dog (länk https://www.thefarmersdog.com/digest/australian-shepherd-care-guide/) since the project is about the form and function, and not so much about the actual content of the paragraphs. 
..*The drop down menu for mobile devices was created with some code from the Love Running code along-project, altered to fit this pages layout. 
The Favicon was created with the help of favicon.io (länk!)
..*All the social media icons in the footer were taken from Font Awesome
..*To pick the color scheme for the page I used Image Color Picker (https://imagecolorpicker.com/en) on the header image. 
..*The Stack Overflow (länk) forum has been my go-to whenever it got stuck with mainly CSS and needed to find my way out. 

###Media
..*All the pictures used in the project – the header image, the image used in the content on the landing page and the images in the About the breed-section were all taken from the Open Source page Pexels (länka!). 
..*All of the images were run through Tinipng (länk!) to make the “lighter” and adapted for display on the web – so that the page doesn’t take to long to load because of heavy image files. 
..*Some of the images used were cropped with the help of Photoshop Express. 



Imperative mood missed in commit messages for the first part of the porject, lost in translation to swedish so didn’t understand that until halfway through the project
